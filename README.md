# Data Structures Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a wide range of data structures in C++. Each data structure is designed to provide efficient and flexible solutions for common programming tasks.

## List

A list is a generic data structure that stores elements in a linear order. This implementation provides a dynamic array-based list with methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements.

## Stack

A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This implementation provides methods for pushing and popping elements onto and from the stack.

## Queue

A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This implementation provides methods for enqueue and dequeue operations.

## Deque

A deque (double-ended queue) is a versatile data structure that allows insertion and deletion at both ends. This implementation provides methods for enqueue and dequeue operations from both the front and rear.

## Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. This implementation provides methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal of elements.

## Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is a linked list where each node contains a data part and two pointers, one pointing to the next node and the other pointing to the previous node. This implementation supports forward and backward traversal.

## Circularly Linked List

A circularly linked list is a linked list where the last node points back to the first node. This implementation provides methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal of elements in a circular manner.

## Maps

A map is a collection of key-value pairs. This implementation provides a basic map structure with methods for adding, removing, and retrieving key-value pairs.

## Tree

A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. This implementation provides a basic tree structure with methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Feel free to explore each data structure's respective directory for detailed implementation and example usage.
